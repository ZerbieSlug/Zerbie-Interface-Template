# Zerbie Interface Template : Intro

> DISCLAIMER : This template only changes how the graphics of the User Interface looks. The layout of buttons/borders/backgrounds/etc can only be changed through SporeModderFX's > .spui editor. This template is only meant to change the overall look of the interface, not the layout

Hello, and thank you for downloading Zerbie's GUI template (Version 4)!

While this template may not cover all of Spore's interface, it should be enought to at least cover the basics!
In this new iteration of the template, there is a copy of the "GUITemplate" folder that labels the images in terms of where/how they're used.

### In this template kit, there should be 2 folders : "GUITemplate" and "GUITemplate_(Labeled)"

- GUI template contains the "Graphics_Atlas" (containing the vital User Interface graphics) and "Editors_" (containing part icons for specific editors) folders

- GUI template (labeled) only contains "Graphics_Atlas", with all assets having a unique label.

# Graphics Atlas contents (explained)

> Below are a set of categories listing off the names and descriptions of graphic assets in the "~graphics_atlas" folder
> Please note that certain editors use duplicate files of the same graphic, so take note of how they're labeled in the "labeled" folder.

Please note that certain pieces of graphics are removed as they are never used in game. This is just to declutter the assets, what you see is what the game uses now!
